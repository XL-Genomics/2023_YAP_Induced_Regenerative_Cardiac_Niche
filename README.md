## YAP Induced Regenerative Cardiac Niche

After myocardial infarction (MI), the mammalian heart fails to renew, and the cardiac microenvironment is irreversibly disrupted. Hippo signaling pathway loss of function, which activates the transcriptional cofactor YAP, can induce heart renewal, and rebuild the post-MI myocardial microenvironment. We investigated adult renewal-competent mouse hearts expressing an active version of YAP, called YAP5SA, to gain insight into poor adult mammalian heart renewal. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell (sc) RNA-sequencing (seq) revealed a conserved, renewal-competent cardiomyocyte (CM) cell state called adult (a)CM2. The aCM2 cell state was also found in renewal competent neonatal hearts after MI. Unexpectedly, aCM2 was also detected in the adult human heart after MI, a renewal incompetent context, suggesting an essential contribution of other cell types in the myocardial microenvironment to heart renewal. ST indicated that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), expressing the central complement pathway component C3, and macrophages (MPs) expressing C3ar1, encoding the receptor for activated C3a, colocalized with aCM2 only in renewal competent contexts. Furthermore, C3 and C3ar1 genetic loss of function experiments indicated that signaling between MPs and CFs, mediated by activated C3a, was required to induce a pro-renewal microenvironment or niche composed of the aCM2, C3+ CF and C3ar1+ MP cellular triad.

The computational framework includes: 
1) Initial processing of sequencing data and QC.
2) Integration of single cell, and single nucleus RNA seqeucning data and spatial transcriptomics data. Cell identity annotationa and visulization.
3) Explorative investigation and visualization of omics datasets.
